```

### 🧠 Memory Layout (Conceptual)
```
Stack  : automatic storage (locals, function frames)
Heap   : dynamic storage via new/delete (manage lifetime)
Static : program-long storage (global/static objects)

Object-oriented

programming:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) aims to implement real-world entities such as
inheritance,

encapsulation,

and

polymorphism

in

programming.

The

primary

goal

of

OOP

is

to

bind

data

and

the

functions

that

operate

on

them

so

that

no

other

part

of

the

code

can

access

this

data

except

through

these

functions.
 Unlike procedural programming, where functions are written to perform operations on data,
OOP

involves

creating

objects

that

contain

both

data

and

functions.
 An object has two characteristics: attributes and behavior. For example, a car can be an
object.

And,

it

has

●

attributes

-

brand,

model,

size,

mileage,

etc.

●

behavior

-

driving,

acceleration,

parking,

etc.

There

are

some

basic

concepts

that

act

as

the

building

blocks

of

OOPs

i.e.

●

Class

●

Object

●

Encapsulation

●

Abstraction

●

Polymorphism

●

Inheritance

●

Dynamic

Binding

●

Message

Passing

Characteristics

of

an

Object-Oriented

Programming

Language


2.1

Class

Basics

in

C++

Class

Declaration

and

Definition

A

class

in

C++

is

a

user-defined

data

type

that

holds

its

own

attributes

(data

members)

and

functions

(methods)
.

These

members

can

be

accessed

and

modified

using

objects

of

the

class.

A

class

serves

as

a

blueprint

for

creating

objects.

Example

Analogy

Think

of

a

class

as

a

car

blueprint

that

defines

its

properties

(
brand,

model,

mileage
)

and

behaviors

(
drive,

brake
).

Once

we

have

the

blueprint,

we

can

create

different

car

objects

based

on

it,

such

as

SUV,

Sedan,

and

Van
.


In

the

above

code,

we

have

used

the

class

keyword

to

create

a

class

named

Car.

Here,

●

brand

and

model

are

class

attributes

used

to

store

data

●

drive()

is

a

class

function

used

to

perform

some

operation



Access

Specifiers

in

C++

Access

specifiers

define

how

members

of

a

class

can

be

accessed

from

outside

the

class.

C++

provides

three

types:

1.

Public

(
public:
)

→

Accessible

from

anywhere.

2.

Private

(
private:
)

→

Only

accessible

within

the

class.

3.

Protected

(
protected:
)

→

Accessible

within

the

class

and

its

derived

(child)

classes.


Member

Variables

(Attributes)

Member

variables

store

the

state

or

data

of

a

class.

For

example,

in

a

Car

class,

attributes

like

brand
,

model
,

and

mileage

store

car

information.


Member

Functions

(Methods)

Functions

inside

a

class

define

the

behavior

of

an

object
.

For

example,

a

car

has

functions

like

drive()

to

increase

mileage

and

show_data()

to

display

details.


Objects:

An

Object

is

an

instance

of

a

Class.

When

a

class

is

defined,

no

memory

is

allocated

but

when

it

is

instantiated

(i.e.

an

object

is

created)

memory

is

allocated.


For

example,

the

Car

class

defines

the

model,

brand,

and

mileage.

Now,

based

on

the

definition.

Object

Creation

and

Destruction

●

Creating

Objects:

When

a

class

is

defined,

no

memory

is

allocated

until

an

object

of

the

class

is

created.

Syntax

for

Object

Creation:


Class_Name

object_name;

Car

suv;

Car

sedan;


Car

van;

●

Object

Destruction:

When

an

object

goes

out

of

scope
,

its

memory

is

automatically

deallocated
.


Scope

Resolution

Operator

(
::
)

The

::

operator

is

used

to

define

a

function

outside

the

class

definition
.

Example:

class

Car

{


public:


string

brand,

model;


int

mileage;


void

drive(int);

};


//

Defining

the

function

outside

the

class

void

Car::drive(int

distance)

{


mileage

+=

distance;

}



Example:

Class

and

Objects

in

C++

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Car

{


public:


//

Attributes


string

brand,

model;


int

mileage

=

0;



//

Function

to

drive

the

car


void

drive(int

distance)

{


mileage

+=

distance;


}




//

Function

to

print

car

details


void

show_data()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Model:

"

<<

model

<<

endl;



cout

<<

"Distance

driven:

"

<<

mileage

<<

"

miles"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


//

Creating

an

object

of

Car

class


Car

my_car;



//

Initializing

object

attributes


my_car.brand

=

"Honda";


my_car.model

=

"Accord";


my_car.drive(50);



//

Displaying

object

attributes


my_car.show_data();



return

0;


}


Explanation:

1.

We

define

a

class

Car

with

attributes

and

methods.

2.

We

create

an

object

my_car
.

3.

We

assign

values

to

my_car.brand

and

my_car.model
.

4.

We

call

the

function

drive()

to

increase

mileage.

5.

We

print

the

details

using

show_data()
.


Understanding

the

‘this’

Pointer

in

C++

The

this

pointer

is

an

implicit

pointer

available

in

all

non-static

member

functions.

It

holds

the

memory

address

of

the

calling

object.

Key

Features

of

this

Pointer:

1.

Refers

to

the

Current

Object:


It

allows

us

to

access

members

of

the

current

object

inside

class

functions.

2.

Helps

Differentiate

Variable

Names:


If

function

parameters

have

the

same

name

as

class

attributes,

we

use

this->

to

distinguish

them.

3.

Used

in

Method

Chaining:


The

this

pointer

allows

function

calls

to

be

chained.

Example

of

this

Pointer

in

C++


#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Car

{


public:


string

brand;


int

mileage;



//

Constructor

using

'this'

pointer


Car(string

brand,

int

mileage)

{


this->brand

=

brand;


this->mileage

=

mileage;


}



//

Function

to

update

mileage


void

drive(int

distance)

{


this->mileage

+=

distance;


}



//

Function

to

display

car

details


void

show_data()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

this->brand

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Mileage:

"

<<

this->mileage

<<

"

miles"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


//

Creating

an

object

of

Car

class


Car

my_car("Toyota",

100);




//

Calling

member

functions


my_car.drive(50);


my_car.show_data();



return

0;

}


Explanation

of

this

Pointer

Usage:

1.

In

the

Constructor:

○

this->brand

=

brand;

assigns

the

constructor

parameter

brand

to

the

object's

attribute

brand
.

2.

In

Member

Functions:

○

this->mileage

+=

distance;

updates

the

mileage

of

the

calling

object.

3.

Calling

Functions:

○

my_car.show_data();

uses

this

implicitly

to

access

object

members.



2.2

Constructors

and

Destructors

in

C++

Constructors

A

constructor

is

a

special

member

function

of

a

class

that

is

automatically

called

when

an

object

of

the

class

is

created.

It

is

used

to

initialize

objects.

Key

Characteristics

of

Constructors:

●

They

have

the

same

name

as

the

class.

●

They

do

not

return

a

value
,

not

even

void
.

●

They

can

be

overloaded

to

create

different

types

of

constructors.


1.

Default

Constructor

A

default

constructor

is

a

constructor

that

takes

no

parameters

and

initializes

class

members

with

default

values
.

Example:

Default

Constructor

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Car

{


public:


string

brand;


int

mileage;



//

Default

constructor


Car()

{


brand

=

"Unknown";


mileage

=

0;



}



void

show_data()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Mileage:

"

<<

mileage

<<

"

miles"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Car

myCar;

//

Default

constructor

is

automatically

called


myCar.show_data();


return

0;

}


Output:

Brand:

Unknown


Mileage:

0

miles



2.

Parameterized

Constructor

A

parameterized

constructor

accepts

arguments

to

initialize

object

attributes

at

the

time

of

object

creation
.

Example:

Parameterized

Constructor

class

Car

{


public:


string

brand;



int

mileage;



//

Parameterized

constructor


Car(string

b,

int

m)

{


brand

=

b;


mileage

=

m;


}



void

show_data()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Mileage:

"

<<

mileage

<<

"

miles"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Car

myCar("Toyota",

5000);

//

Passing

values

during

object

creation


myCar.show_data();


return

0;

}


Output:

Brand:

Toyota


Mileage:

5000

miles



3.

Copy

Constructor


A

copy

constructor

initializes

a

new

object

by

copying

attributes

from

an

existing

object.

Syntax:

ClassName

(const

ClassName

&oldObject)

{

}


Example:

Copy

Constructor

class

Car

{


public:


string

brand;


int

mileage;



//

Parameterized

constructor


Car(string

b,

int

m)

{


brand

=

b;


mileage

=

m;


}



//

Copy

constructor


Car(const

Car

&obj)

{


brand

=

obj.brand;


mileage

=

obj.mileage;


}



void

show_data()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Mileage:

"

<<

mileage

<<

"

miles"

<<

endl;


}


};


int

main()

{


Car

car1("Ford",

8000);

//

Creating

first

object


Car

car2

=

car1;

//

Copying

car1

into

car2

using

copy

constructor



car2.show_data();

//

Output

will

be

the

same

as

car1


return

0;

}


Output:

Brand:

Ford


Mileage:

8000

miles



4.

Constructor

Overloading

Constructor

overloading

means

defining

multiple

constructors

in

a

class

with

different

parameters
.

Example:

Constructor

Overloading

class

Car

{


public:


string

brand;


int

mileage;



//

Default

constructor


Car()

{



brand

=

"Unknown";


mileage

=

0;


}



//

Parameterized

constructor


Car(string

b,

int

m)

{


brand

=

b;


mileage

=

m;


}



void

show_data()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Mileage:

"

<<

mileage

<<

"

miles"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Car

car1;

//

Calls

default

constructor


Car

car2("BMW",

3000);

//

Calls

parameterized

constructor



car1.show_data();


car2.show_data();



return

0;

}



Output:

Brand:

Unknown


Mileage:

0

miles


Brand:

BMW


Mileage:

3000

miles



5.

Constructor

Initialization

List

Instead

of

assigning

values

inside

the

constructor

body,

we

can

use

an

initialization

list

to

initialize

attributes

more

efficiently
.

Example:

Constructor

Initialization

List

class

Car

{


public:


string

brand;


int

mileage;


//

Constructor

using

initialization

list


Car(string

b,

int

m)

:

brand(b),

mileage(m)

{

}


void

show_data()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Mileage:

"

<<

mileage

<<

"

miles"

<<

endl;


}

};

int

main()

{


Car

car1("Tesla",

12000);


car1.show_data();


return

0;

}



🔹

The

initialization

list

makes

object

initialization

more

efficient.


6.

Destructor

A

destructor

is

a

special

function

that

is

automatically

called

when

an

object

goes

out

of

scope

or

is

explicitly

deleted.

It

is

used

to

free

resources

like

memory,

files,

etc.

Key

Features

of

Destructors:

●

They

have

the

same

name

as

the

class,

but

preceded

by

a

tilde

(~)
.

●

No

parameters

and

no

return

type
.

●

Automatically

called

when

an

object

is

destroyed.

Example:

Destructor

Implementation

class

Car

{


public:


string

brand;


//

Constructor


Car(string

b)

{


brand

=

b;


cout

<<

"Car

<<

"

created."

<<

endl;


}



//

Destructor


~Car()

{


cout

<<

"Car

<<

brand

<<

"

destroyed."

<<

endl;


}

};

int

main()

{


Car

myCar("Audi");

//

Constructor

is

called



//

Destructor

will

be

called

automatically

when

myCar

destroyed.


7.

Constructor

Delegation

Constructor

delegation

means

one

constructor

calling

another

constructor

within

the

int

mileage;


//

Delegating

constructor


Car()

:

Car("Unknown",

0)

{

}


//

Parameterized

constructor


Car(string

b,

int

m)

{


brand

=

b;


mileage

=

m;


}


void

show_data()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Mileage:

"

<<

mileage

<<

"

miles"

<<

endl;


}


};

int

main()

{


Car

car1;

//

Calls

default

constructor,

which

delegates

to

parameterized

constructor


car1.show_data();


return

0;

}

Output:

Brand:

2.3

Object

Lifecycle

in

C++

Understanding

the

lifecycle

of

an

object

is

crucial

in

C++

programming.

Objects

go

through

several

phases:

1.

Creation

(Instantiation)

2.

Usage

(Active

Lifetime)

3.

Destruction

(Deallocation)

These

phases

depend

on

where

and

how

the

object

is

created.

C++

provides

different

ways

to

manage

objects

in

stack,

heap,

and

static

memory
.


1.

Object

Lifecycle

Phases

Phase

Description

Object

Creation

Memory

is

allocated,

and

the

constructor

is

called.

Object

Usage

The

object

is

used

for

computations,

data

storage,

or

operations.


Object

Destruction

The

destructor

is

called,

and

memory

is

deallocated.


2.

Object

Creation

in

Different

Memory

Regions

Objects

can

be

created

in

different

memory

regions
,

affecting

their

lifespan

and

behavior.

Storage

Type

Memory

Region

Creation

Destruction

Automatic

(Local)

Stack

Created

when

function

is

called.

Destroyed

when

function

ends.

Dynamic

(Heap)

Heap

Created

using

new
.

Must

be

manually

deleted

using

delete
.

Static

Global/Static

Memory

Created

once

and

persists

throughout

the

program.

Destroyed

at

program

termination.


3.

Static

Objects

(Global/Static

Memory)

🔹

Exist

throughout

the

program.


🔹

Destroyed

only

when

the

program

ends.


🔹

Useful

for

maintaining

state

between

function

calls.

Example:

Static

Object

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Car

{


public:



Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

object

created.\n";

}


~Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

object

destroyed.\n";

}

};


void

demo()

{


static

Car

myCar;

//

Static

object

(created

once)

}


int

main()

{


demo();


cout

<<

"Back

in

main.\n";


demo();

//

Uses

the

same

static

object


return

0;

}


Output:

Car

object

created.

Back

in

main.

Back

in

main.

Car

object

destroyed.

//

Destroyed

when

the

program

ends


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

A

static

object

is

created

only

once

and

is

destroyed

at

program

termination
.


4.

Automatic

Objects

(Stack

Memory

-

Local

Scope)


🔹

Created

inside

a

function

and

stored

in

the

stack.


🔹

Automatically

destroyed

when

the

function

exits.


🔹

Faster

allocation

and

deallocation

compared

to

dynamic

objects.

Example:

Automatic

Object

class

Car

{


public:


Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

created.\n";

}


~Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

destroyed.\n";

}

};


void

demo()

{


Car

myCar;

//

Automatic

object

(Stack)

}


int

main()

{


demo();

//

Car

created

inside

function


cout

<<

"Back

in

main.\n";


return

0;

}


Output:

Car

created.

Car

destroyed.

//

Destroyed

when

function

exits

Back

in

main.


✅

Key

Takeaway:


●

Automatic

objects

exist

only

inside

the

function

where

they

are

created

and

are

destroyed

when

the

function

ends.


5.

Dynamic

Objects

(Heap

Memory

-

Manual

Allocation)

🔹

Created

using

new

and

stored

in

heap

memory.


🔹

Exist

until

explicitly

deleted

using

delete
.


🔹

Must

be

manually

managed

to

prevent

memory

leaks.

Example:

Dynamic

Object

class

Car

{


public:


Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

created.\n";

}


~Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

destroyed.\n";

}

};


int

main()

{


Car*

myCar

=

new

Car();

//

Dynamic

object

in

heap


delete

myCar;

//

Free

memory


return

0;

}


Output:

Car

created.

Car

destroyed.


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Forgetting

to

use

delete

causes

memory

leaks

because

the

object

remains

in

memory.



6.

Object

Arrays

We

can

create

arrays

of

objects

using

static

or

dynamic

allocation.

Example:

Static

Object

Array

class

Car

{


public:


Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

created.\n";

}


~Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

destroyed.\n";

}

};


int

main()

{


Car

cars[3];

//

Array

of

objects

in

stack


return

0;

}


Output:

Car

created.

Car

created.

Car

created.

Car

destroyed.

Car

destroyed.

Car

destroyed.


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Objects

in

a

static

array

are

automatically

destroyed

when

main()

ends.



Example:

Dynamic

Object

Array

class

Car

{


public:


Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

created.\n";

}


~Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

destroyed.\n";

}

};


int

main()

{


Car*

cars

=

new

Car[3];

//

Dynamic

array

in

heap


delete[]

cars;

//

Must

use

delete[]


return

0;

}


Output:

Car

created.

Car

created.

Car

created.

Car

destroyed.

Car

destroyed.

Car

destroyed.


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

When

deleting

a

dynamic

object

array
,

use

delete[]

instead

of

delete
.



7.

Memory

Management

with

new

and

delete

Rules

for

Proper

Memory

Management

✅

Use

new

to

allocate

memory

dynamically.


✅

Use

delete

to

free

single

objects
.


✅

Use

delete[]

to

free

object

arrays
.


✅

Forgetting

delete

leads

to

memory

leaks
.

Example:

Memory

Leak

(Improper

Deallocation)

void

leak()

{


int*

ptr

=

new

int(10);

//

Memory

allocated

but

not

freed

}


🔹

Every

time

leak()

runs,

memory

is

lost

because

delete

is

missing.


Example:

Proper

Memory

Management

void

safe()

{


int*

ptr

=

new

int(10);


delete

ptr;

//

Memory

freed

}

🔹

Here,

we

correctly

free

the

allocated

memory
.


3.

Encapsulation

in

C++

Encapsulation

is

one

of

the

key

principles

of

Object-Oriented

Programming

(OOP)
.

It

is

the

process

of

binding

data

(variables)

and

functions

(methods)

together

into

a

single

unit
,

called

a

class
,

and

restricting

direct

access

to

the

data.



Why

Encapsulation?

✅

Data

Protection

→

Prevents

accidental

modification

of

sensitive

data.


✅

Code

Maintainability

→

Improves

readability

and

modularity.


✅

Control

Over

Data

→

Allows

controlled

access

using

getter

and

setter

functions.


✅

Security

→

Prevents

unauthorized

access

to

class

attributes.


3.1

Data

Hiding

🔹

Data

hiding

is

a

fundamental

concept

of

encapsulation

that

restricts

direct

access

to

class

members

(variables)

to

ensure

controlled

access

through

methods.

Access

Modifiers

(
public
,

private
,

protected
)

help

enforce

data

hiding.

1.

Private

Members

🔹

Private

members

can

only

be

accessed

within

the

same

class.

They

are

not

accessible

from

outside

the

class.

Example:

Private

Members

(Data

Hiding)

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;



class

Car

{


private:


string

brand;

//

Private

attribute

(Cannot

be

accessed

outside)




public:


void

setBrand(string

b)

{

//

Public

setter

function


brand

=

b;


}



void

getBrand()

{

//

Public

getter

function


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Car

myCar;


//

myCar.brand

=

"Toyota";

//

❌

Error:

brand

is

private


myCar.setBrand("Toyota");

//

✅

Allowed

(Using

setter)


myCar.getBrand();

//

✅

Allowed

(Using

getter)


return

0;

}


Output:

Brand:

Toyota



✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Private

members

cannot

be

accessed

directly

but

can

be

modified

using

public

methods
.


2.

Public

Interface

🔹

Public

members

define

the

interface

of

the

class.


🔹

They

provide

controlled

access

to

private

members

using

getter

and

setter

functions
.

Best

Practice:

Keep

data

members

private

and

use

public

methods

to

access

them.


3.

Protected

Members

🔹

Protected

members

are

like

private

members
,

but

they

can

be

accessed

in

derived

(child)

classes
.

Example:

Protected

Members

class

Vehicle

{


protected:


int

speed;

//

Protected

variable



public:


void

setSpeed(int

s)

{


speed

=

s;


}

};


class

Car

:

public

Vehicle

{


public:


void

showSpeed()

{



cout

<<

"Speed:

"

<<

speed

<<

"

km/h"

<<

endl;

//

✅

Allowed

(Inherited

class)


}

};


int

main()

{


Car

myCar;


myCar.setSpeed(80);


myCar.showSpeed();


return

0;

}


Output:

Speed:

80

km/h


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Protected

members

are

accessible

in

derived

classes

but

not

from

outside

the

class.


4.

Getter

and

Setter

Methods

🔹

Getter

methods

are

used

to

retrieve

private

data.


🔹

Setter

methods

are

used

to

modify

private

data

safely.

Example:

Using

Getter

and

Setter

Methods

class

BankAccount

{


private:


double

balance;




public:


void

setBalance(double

b)

{

//

Setter

method


if

(b

>=

0)


balance

=

b;


else


cout

<<

"Invalid

balance!"

<<

endl;


}



double

getBalance()

{

//

Getter

method


return

balance;


}

};


int

main()

{


BankAccount

account;


account.setBalance(500);


cout

<<

"Current

Balance:

$"

<<

account.getBalance()

<<

endl;


return

0;

}


Output:

Current

Balance:

$500


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Encapsulation

helps

prevent

invalid

data

input

by

using

setter

functions.



5.

Friend

Functions

and

Classes

🔹

Friend

functions

allow

an

external

function

to

access

private

members

of

a

class.


🔹

Friend

classes

allow

another

class

to

access

the

private

members

of

a

class.

Example:

Friend

Function

class

Car

{


private:


string

brand

=

"Ford";



public:


friend

void

showBrand(Car

c);

//

Friend

function

declaration

};


void

showBrand(Car

c)

{


cout

<<

"Car

Brand:

"

<<

c.brand

<<

endl;

//

✅

Allowed

(Friend

function)

}


int

main()

{


Car

myCar;


showBrand(myCar);


return

0;

}


Output:

Car

Brand:

Ford


✅

Key

Takeaway:


●

A

friend

function

can

access

private

members

without

being

a

member

of

the

class
.


6.

const

Member

Functions

🔹

const

member

functions

do

not

modify

the

object's

data.


🔹

Helps

ensure

data

integrity
.

Example:

Using

const

Member

Function

class

Car

{


private:


string

brand

=

"Toyota";



public:


void

showBrand()

const

{

//

Const

function


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Car

myCar;


myCar.showBrand();

//

✅

Allowed


return

0;

}


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Const

member

functions

ensure

the

function

does

not

modify

class

attributes.



3.2

Properties

and

Access

Control

in

C++

Encapsulation

is

crucial

for

controlling

access

to

class

properties.

In

C++,

we

can

define

properties

with

different

access

levels

to

protect

data

and

ensure

it

is

used

correctly.


1.

Read-Only

Properties

A

read-only

property

allows

data

to

be

retrieved

but

not

modified

after

initialization.

This

is

done

using

a

getter

function

but

no

setter.

Example:

Read-Only

Property

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Employee

{


private:


int

id;

//

Private

attribute



public:


//

Constructor

to

initialize

id


Employee(int

empId)

{

id

=

empId;

}



//

Getter

function

(Read-only)


int

getId()

const

{


return

id;


}

};


int

main()

{



Employee

emp(101);


cout

<<

"Employee

ID:

"

<<

emp.getId()

<<

endl;



//

emp.id

=

102;

❌

Error:

Private

attribute

cannot

be

modified

directly


//

emp.setId(102);

❌

No

setter

function

available



return

0;

}


Output:

Employee

ID:

101


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

No

setter

function

means

the

property

cannot

be

changed

after

object

creation.

●

The

getter

function

provides

read

access.


2.

Write-Only

Properties

A

write-only

property

allows

modification

but

not

direct

retrieval
.

This

is

useful

when

storing

sensitive

data

(e.g.,

passwords).

Example:

Write-Only

Property

class

User

{


private:


string

password;



public:


//

Setter

function

(Write-only)



void

setPassword(string

pass)

{


password

=

pass;


}

};


int

main()

{


User

user;


user.setPassword("Secure123");



//

cout

<<

user.password;

❌

Error:

Cannot

access

private

member


//

cout

<<

user.getPassword();

❌

No

getter

function

available



return

0;

}


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Write-only

properties

are

useful

for

security

(e.g.,

storing

passwords).

●

No

getter

function

prevents

unauthorized

access.


3.

Computed

Properties

A

computed

property

is

not

stored

directly

but

is

calculated

dynamically

based

on

other

properties.

Example:

Computed

Property

class

Rectangle

{


private:


int

width,

height;




public:


Rectangle(int

w,

int

h)

{

width

=

w;

height

=

h;

}



//

Computed

property:

Area

(No

need

for

separate

storage)


int

getArea()

const

{


return

width

*

height;


}

};


int

main()

{


Rectangle

rect(5,

10);


cout

<<

"Area:

"

<<

rect.getArea()

<<

endl;

//

Computed

dynamically


return

0;

}


Output:

Area:

50


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Computed

properties

are

dynamically

calculated

based

on

existing

data.

●

No

need

to

store

separate

variables

for

computed

values.


4.

Access

Control

Patterns

C++

provides

various

access

control

patterns

using

private
,

protected
,

and

public

access

specifiers.

Common

Access

Control

Patterns:


1.

Encapsulation

with

Getters

&

Setters

(Used

for

controlling

access)

2.

Protected

Members

in

Inheritance

(Used

for

extending

functionality)

3.

Friend

Functions

&

Friend

Classes

(Allow

external

access

when

necessary)

4.

Const

Member

Functions

(Prevent

accidental

modification)

Example:

Access

Control

with

Getters

&

Setters

class

BankAccount

{


private:


double

balance;



public:


BankAccount(double

initialBalance)

{


balance

=

initialBalance;


}



//

Getter

function


double

getBalance()

const

{


return

balance;


}



//

Setter

function

with

validation


void

setBalance(double

amount)

{


if

(amount

>=

0)


balance

=

amount;


else


cout

<<

"Invalid

balance!"

<<

endl;


}

};



int

main()

{


BankAccount

account(500);


cout

<<

"Current

Balance:

$"

<<

account.getBalance()

<<

endl;



account.setBalance(1000);

//

Valid

update


cout

<<

"Updated

Balance:

$"

<<

account.getBalance()

<<

endl;



account.setBalance(-200);

//

Invalid

update


return

0;

}


Output:

Current

Balance:

$500

Updated

Balance:

$1000

Invalid

balance!


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Encapsulation

ensures

controlled

access

to

private

data
.

●

Setters

can

include

validation

to

prevent

incorrect

values.


5.

Data

Validation

in

Setters

🔹

Data

validation

ensures

that

only

valid

values

are

assigned

to

properties.


🔹

This

helps

prevent

errors

and

enforce

business

rules
.

Example:

Data

Validation

in

Setters

class

Student

{



private:


int

age;



public:


void

setAge(int

a)

{


if

(a

>

0

&&

a

<

120)

//

Ensuring

valid

age


age

=

a;


else


cout

<<

"Invalid

age!"

<<

endl;


}



int

getAge()

const

{


return

age;


}

};


int

main()

{


Student

student;


student.setAge(20);


cout

<<

"Age:

"

<<

student.getAge()

<<

endl;



student.setAge(-5);

//

Invalid

input


return

0;

}


Output:


Age:

20

Invalid

age!


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Setters

should

validate

data

before

modifying

private

attributes.

●

Prevents

invalid

or

dangerous

values

from

being

stored.



4.

Inheritance

in

C++

Inheritance

is

one

of

the

four

main

pillars

of

Object-Oriented

Programming

(OOP)
.

It

allows

a

new

class

(child

class

or

derived

class)

to

inherit

properties

and

behavior

from

an

existing

class

(parent

class

or

base

class)
.

Why

Inheritance?

✔

Code

Reusability

→

Avoid

rewriting

the

same

code

4.1

Basic

Inheritance

Syntax

of

Inheritance

class

BaseClass

{


//

Base

class

members

};


class

DerivedClass

:

public

BaseClass

{


//

Derived

class

members

};


Here,

DerivedClass

inherits

from

BaseClass
,

meaning

it

gets

access

to

its

members

based

on

access

specifiers.



1.

Single

Inheritance

A

single

derived

class

inherits

from

a

single

base

class
.

Example:

Single

Inheritance

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


//

Base

class

class

Vehicle

{


public:


void

move()

{


cout

<<

"This

vehicle

is

moving!"

<<

endl;


}

};


//

Derived

class

class

Car

:

public

Vehicle

{


public:


void

honk()

{


cout

<<

"Car

is

honking!"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Car

myCar;


myCar.move();

//

Inherited

function

from

Vehicle

class


myCar.honk();

//

Function

from

Car

class


return

0;

}


Output:

This

vehicle

is

moving!

Car

is

honking!


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

The

Car

class

inherits

the

move()

function

from

Vehicle
.

●

It

can

also

have

its

own

functions

like

honk()
.


2.

Multiple

Inheritance


A

child

class

inherits

from

multiple

parent

classes
.

Example:

Multiple

Inheritance

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


//

First

Base

Class

class

Engine

{


public:


void

start()

{


cout

<<

"Engine

started!"

<<

endl;


}

};


//

Second

Base

Class

class

Wheels

{


public:


void

rotate()

{


cout

<<

"Wheels

are

rotating!"

<<

endl;


}

};


//

Derived

Class

class

Car

:

public

Engine,

public

Wheels

{


public:


void

drive()

{


cout

<<

"Car

is

driving!"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Car

myCar;


myCar.start();

//

Inherited

from

Engine

class


myCar.rotate();

//

Inherited

from

Wheels

class


myCar.drive();

//

Function

of

Car

class


return

0;

}


Output:

Engine

started!

Wheels

are

rotating!

Car

is

driving!


✅

Key

Takeaway:


●

Multiple

inheritance

allows

a

class

to

inherit

from

multiple

base

classes
.

●

Be

careful

with

naming

conflicts

if

both

base

classes

have

functions

with

the

same

name.


3.

Multi-Level

Inheritance

A

class

inherits

from

another

derived

class
,

forming

a

chain
.

Example:

Multi-Level

Inheritance

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


//

Base

Class

class

Vehicle

{


public:


void

move()

{


cout

<<

"This

vehicle

moves!"

<<

endl;


}

};


//

Derived

Class

(Child

of

Vehicle)

class

Car

:

public

Vehicle

{


public:


void

honk()

{


cout

<<

"Car

is

honking!"

<<

endl;


}

};


//

Further

Derived

Class

(Child

of

Car)

class

SportsCar

:

public

Car

{


public:


void

turboBoost()

{


cout

<<

"SportsCar

activated

Turbo

Boost!"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


SportsCar

myCar;


myCar.move();

//

Inherited

from

Vehicle


myCar.honk();

//

Inherited

from

Car


myCar.turboBoost();//

Own

function


return

0;

}



Output:

This

vehicle

moves!

Car

is

honking!

SportsCar

activated

Turbo

Boost!


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Multi-level

inheritance

allows

deeper

hierarchy

levels
.

●

Each

derived

class

inherits

all

public

and

protected

members

from

its

parent.


4.

Access

Modes

in

Inheritance

C++

provides

three

modes

of

inheritance
:

Mode

Private

Members

Protected

Members

Public

Members

✅

Accessible


cout

<<

"y:

"

<<

y

<<

endl;

//

✅

Accessible


//

cout

<<

"z:

"

<<

z;

❌

Error:

Private

members

are

not

inherited


}


};


int

main()

{


Derived

obj;


obj.show();


return

0;

}


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Public

inheritance

keeps

the

base

class's

public

members

public

and

protected

members

protected
.

●

Private

members

are

never

inherited
.


5.

Base

Class

Initialization

When

a

derived

class

object

is

created,

the

base

class

constructor

runs

first.

Example:

Base

Class

Constructor

Execution

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Base

{


public:


Base()

{


cout

<<

"Base

class

constructor

called!"

<<

endl;


}

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{


public:


Derived()

{


cout

<<

"Derived

class

constructor

called!"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Derived

obj;


return

0;

}


Output:

Base

class

constructor

called!


Derived

class

constructor

called!


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

The

base

class

constructor

is

always

called

first

when

an

object

of

the

derived

class

is

created.


6.

Constructor

Chaining

To

initialize

a

base

class

with

parameters,

use

constructor

chaining
.

Example:

Constructor

Chaining

class

Base

{


protected:


int

data;


public:


Base(int

x)

{



data

=

x;


cout

<<

"Base

class

initialized

with

"

<<

x

<<

endl;


}

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{


public:


Derived(int

y)

:

Base(y)

{

//

Pass

argument

to

Base

constructor


cout

<<

"Derived

class

initialized

with

"

<<

y

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Derived

obj(50);


return

0;

}


Output:

Base

class

initialized

with

50

Derived

class

initialized

with

50


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Derived

class

constructor

can

pass

parameters

to

the

base

class

constructor
.



4.2

Advanced

Inheritance

in

C++


1.

Virtual

Functions

A

virtual

function

is

a

member

function

in

a

base

class

that

can

be

overridden

in

a

derived

class
.

It

enables

runtime

polymorphism

(dynamic

method

dispatch).

Why

Virtual

Functions?

Without

virtual

functions,

C++

performs

early

binding

(deciding

which

function

to

call

at

compile-time).

With

virtual

functions,

late

binding

(runtime

binding)

occurs,

ensuring

that

the

correct

function

of

the

derived

class

is

called.

Example:

Virtual

Function

in

C++

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Base

{


public:


virtual

void

show()

{

//

Virtual

function


cout

<<

"Base

class

function"

<<

endl;


}

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{


public:


void

show()

override

{

//

Function

overriding


cout

<<

"Derived

class

function"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Base*

obj;

//

Pointer

to

Base

class


Derived

d;


obj

=

&d;




obj->show();

//

Calls

Derived

class

function

due

to

late

binding


return

0;

}



Output:

Derived

class

function


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

The

show()

function

in

the

Derived

class

overrides

the

base

class

version

because

of

virtual
.

●

If

virtual

was

removed,

the

Base

class

function

would

have

been

called

instead

(early

binding).


2.

Abstract

Classes

and

Pure

Virtual

Functions

An

abstract

class

in

C++

cannot

be

instantiated
.

It

serves

as

a

blueprint

for

derived

classes.

A

class

becomes

abstract

when

it

has

at

least

one

pure

virtual

function
.

A

pure

virtual

function

is

declared

using

=

0

syntax

and

must

be

overridden

in

derived

classes.

Example:

Abstract

Class

&

Pure

Virtual

Function

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


//

Abstract

class

class

Shape

{


public:


virtual

void

draw()

=

0;

//

Pure

virtual

function

};


class

Circle

:

public

Shape

{


public:


void

draw()

override

{


cout

<<

"Drawing

Circle"

<<

endl;


}

};


class

Square

:

public

Shape

{


public:


void

draw()

override

{


cout

<<

"Drawing

Square"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{



Shape*

s1

=

new

Circle();


Shape*

s2

=

new

Square();



s1->draw();

//

Calls

Circle's

draw()


s2->draw();

//

Calls

Square's

draw()



delete

s1;


delete

s2;


return

0;

}


Output:

Drawing

Circle

Drawing

Square


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Shape

is

an

abstract

class

since

it

has

a

pure

virtual

function
.

●

Derived

classes

must

override

pure

virtual

functions.


3.

Interface

Implementation

In

C++,

interfaces

are

simulated

using

abstract

classes

with

only

pure

virtual

functions.

Example:

Interface

in

C++

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


//

Interface

(Abstract

Class

with

only

Pure

Virtual

Functions)

class

Drawable

{


public:


virtual

void

draw()

=

0;

//

Pure

virtual

function

};


class

Circle

:

public

Drawable

{


public:


void

draw()

override

{


cout

<<

"Drawing

Circle"

<<

endl;


}

};


class

Rectangle

:

public

Drawable

{


public:



void

draw()

override

{


cout

<<

"Drawing

Rectangle"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Drawable*

obj1

=

new

Circle();


Drawable*

obj2

=

new

Rectangle();



obj1->draw();

//

Calls

Circle's

draw()


obj2->draw();

//

Calls

Rectangle's

draw()



delete

obj1;


delete

obj2;


return

0;

}


Output:

Drawing

Circle

Drawing

Rectangle


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Interfaces

in

C++

are

simulated

using

abstract

classes
.

●

The

class

Drawable

has

only

pure

virtual

functions
,

making

it

act

as

an

interface
.


4.

The

Diamond

Problem

The

diamond

problem

occurs

in

multiple

inheritance

when

a

class

inherits

from

two

classes

that

both

inherit

from

a

common

base

class
.

This

can

lead

to

ambiguity

in

function

calls.

Problem

Example:

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

A

{


public:


void

show()

{


cout

<<

"Class

A"

<<

endl;


}

};



class

B

:

public

A

{};

//

Inherits

A

class

C

:

public

A

{};

//

Inherits

A


class

D

:

public

B,

public

C

{};

//

D

has

two

copies

of

A


int

main()

{


D

obj;


//

obj.show();

//

❌

ERROR:

Ambiguous

function

call


return

0;

}


Why

is

this

an

issue?

●

D

inherits

A

twice

(once

via

B

and

once

via

C
),

creating

two

separate

copies

of

A
.

●

Calling

show()

from

D

causes

ambiguity

(compiler

doesn't

know

which

A::show()

to

call).


5.

Virtual

Inheritance

(Solution

to

Diamond

Problem)

To

resolve

the

diamond

problem
,

use

virtual

inheritance
.

This

ensures

only

one

instance

of

the

base

class

exists
.

Solution:

Using

Virtual

Inheritance

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

A

{


public:


void

show()

{


cout

<<

"Class

A"

<<

endl;


}

};


class

B

:

virtual

public

A

{};

//

Virtual

Inheritance

class

C

:

virtual

public

A

{};

//

Virtual

Inheritance


class

D

:

public

B,

public

C

{};

//

No

duplicate

copies

of

A


int

main()

{


D

obj;


obj.show();

//

✅

Calls

A::show()

without

ambiguity


return

0;

}



Output:

Class

A


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

B

and

C

inherit

A

virtually
,

ensuring

only

one

copy

of

A

exists

in

D
.

●

Virtual

inheritance

solves

ambiguity

issues

in

multiple

inheritance.


5.

Polymorphism

in

C++

Polymorphism

means

"many

forms."

In

C++,

it

allows

functions

or

operators

to

behave

differently

based

on

the

input

type

or

context
.

There

are

two

types

of

polymorphism

in

C++:

1.

Compile-time

polymorphism

(Early

Binding

or

Static

Polymorphism)

2.

Run-time

polymorphism

(Late

Binding

or

Dynamic

Polymorphism)

This

section

covers

compile-time

polymorphism
.


5.1

Compile-time

Polymorphism

Compile-time

polymorphism

is

achieved

using:


✔

Function

Overloading


✔

Operator

Overloading


✔

Templates

(Function

&

Class

Templates)


✔

Static

Binding

1.

Function

Overloading

Function

overloading

allows

multiple

functions

with

the

same

name

but

different

parameters

(different

number

or

types

of

parameters).

Example:

Function

Overloading

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;



class

Math

{


public:


//

Function

to

add

two

integers


int

add(int

a,

int

b)

{


return

a

+

b;


}



//

Function

to

add

three

integers


int

add(int

a,

int

b,

int

c)

{


return

a

+

b

+

c;


}



//

Function

to

add

two

double

values


double

add(double

a,

double

b)

{


return

a

+

b;


}

};


int

main()

{


Math

obj;


cout

<<

"Sum

of

2

integers:

"

<<

obj.add(5,

10)

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Sum

of

3

integers:

"

<<

obj.add(5,

10,

15)

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Sum

of

2

doubles:

"

<<

obj.add(3.5,

2.2)

<<

endl;


return

0;

}


Output:

Sum

of

2

integers:

15

Sum

of

3

integers:

30

Sum

of

2

doubles:

5.7


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

The

same

function

name

(
add
)

is

used,

but

with

different

parameters
.

●

The

compiler

determines

which

function

to

call

at

compile-time

(static

binding).


2.

Operator

Overloading

C++

allows

us

to

overload

operators

to

work

with

user-defined

types

(e.g.,

classes).

Example:

Overloading

+

Operator

#include

<iostream>


using

namespace

std;


class

Complex

{


public:


int

real,

imag;



Complex(int

r,

int

i)

:

real(r),

imag(i)

{}



//

Overload

+

operator


Complex

operator+(const

Complex&

obj)

{


return

Complex(real

+

obj.real,

imag

+

obj.imag);


}



void

display()

{


cout

<<

real

<<

"

+

"

<<

imag

<<

"i"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Complex

c1(3,

4),

c2(1,

2);


Complex

c3

=

c1

+

c2;

//

Calls

overloaded

operator+


c3.display();



return

0;

}


Output:

4

+

6i


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

The

+

operator

is

overloaded

to

work

with

the

Complex

class.

●

This

enables

adding

two

objects

like

primitive

data

types
.


3.

Template

Functions

Templates

allow

writing

generic

functions

that

work

with

any

data

type
.

Example:

Template

Function

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


//

Template

function

template

<typename

T>


T

findMax(T

a,

T

b)

{


return

(a

>

b)

?

a

:

b;

}


int

main()

{


cout

<<

"Max

of

5

and

10:

"

<<

findMax(5,

10)

<<

endl;


cout

<<

"Max

of

3.5

and

2.8:

"

<<

findMax(3.5,

2.8)

<<

endl;


return

0;

}


Output:

Max

of

5

and

10:

10

Max

of

3.5

and

2.8:

3.5


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

The

same

function

works

with

both

integers

and

floating-point

numbers
.

●

The

compiler

automatically

generates

function

definitions

for

the

required

data

types.


4.

Template

Classes

Template

classes

allow

creating

reusable,

type-independent

classes
.

Example:

Template

Class

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


//

Template

class

template

<typename

T>

class

Box

{


private:


T

value;


public:


Box(T

val)

:

value(val)

{}


void

show()

{

cout

<<

"Value:

"

<<

value

<<

endl;

}

};


int

main()

{


Box<int>

intBox(10);


Box<double>

doubleBox(5.5);



intBox.show();



doubleBox.show();




return

0;

}


Output:

Value:

10

Value:

5.5


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Box<int>

works

with

integers,

and

Box<double>

works

with

floating-point

numbers.

●

A

single

template

definition

handles

multiple

data

types.


5.

Static

Binding

Static

binding

happens

at

compile-time
,

meaning

the

compiler

determines

which

function

to

call

before

execution
.

Example:

Static

Binding

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Base

{


public:


void

show()

{

//

Non-virtual

function


cout

<<

"Base

class

function"

<<

endl;


}

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{


public:


void

show()

{

//

Function

Overriding

(Not

Virtual)


cout

<<

"Derived

class

function"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Base*

obj;


Derived

d;


obj

=

&d;





obj->show();

//

Calls

Base

class

function

due

to

static

binding


return

0;

}


Output:

Base

class

function


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Since

show()

in

Base

is

not

virtual
,

static

binding

happens.

●

Even

though

obj

points

to

a

Derived

object,

Base::show()

is

called.

●

To

enable

dynamic

binding,

use

virtual

in

the

base

class

function.


5.2

Runtime

Polymorphism

in

C++

Runtime

polymorphism

allows

function

calls

to

be

resolved

at

runtime

instead

of

compile-time
.

It

is

achieved

through:


✔

Virtual

functions


✔

Dynamic

binding


✔

1.

Virtual

Functions

A

virtual

function

in

C++

is

a

function

declared

in

the

base

class

and

overridden

in

the

derived

class
.

When

using

a

base

class

pointer
,

the

function

call

is

resolved

at

runtime
,

ensuring

the

correct

function

is

called

from

the

derived

class
.

Example:

Virtual

Function

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Base

{

public:



virtual

void

show()

{

//

Virtual

function


cout

<<

"Base

class

show()

function"

<<

endl;


}

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{

public:


void

show()

override

{

//

Overriding

base

class

function


cout

<<

"Derived

class

show()

function"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Base*

ptr;



Derived

d;



ptr

=

&d;

//

Base

class

pointer

pointing

to

Derived

class

object



ptr->show();

//

Calls

Derived's

show()

due

to

runtime

polymorphism


return

0;

}


Output:

Derived

class

show()

function


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

If

show()

in

Base

was

not

virtual
,

the

base

class

version

would

have

been

called.


●

Since

show()

is

virtual
,

the

derived

class

version

is

called

at

runtime
.


2.

Dynamic

Binding

(Late

Binding)

Dynamic

binding

means

function

calls

are

resolved

at

runtime

using

the

vtable

(virtual

table)

mechanism.

Example:

Without

Virtual

Function

(Static

Binding)

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Base

{

public:


void

show()

{

//

Not

virtual


cout

<<

"Base

class

show()

function"

<<

endl;


}

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{

public:


void

show()

{

//

Overriding

function


cout

<<

"Derived

class

show()

function"

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{


Base*

ptr;


Derived

d;



ptr

=

&d;



ptr->show();

//

Calls

Base's

show()

due

to

static

binding


return

0;

}


Output:

Base

class

show()

function


💡

Solution?

Use

virtual

functions

to

enable

dynamic

binding!


3.

Virtual

Destructors

If

a

class

has

virtual

functions,

always

use

a

virtual

destructor

to

ensure

proper

cleanup

of

derived

class

objects
.

Example:

Without

Virtual

Destructor

(Memory

Leak)

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Base

{

public:


Base()

{

cout

<<

"Base

Constructor"

<<

endl;

}


~Base()

{

cout

<<

"Base

Destructor"

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{

public:



Derived()

{

cout

<<

"Derived

Constructor"

<<

endl;

}


~Derived()

{

cout

<<

"Derived

Destructor"

<<

endl;

}

};


int

main()

{


Base*

ptr

=

new

Derived();


delete

ptr;

//

Only

Base

destructor

is

called!


return

0;

}


Output

(Incorrect

Cleanup)

Base

Constructor

Derived

Constructor

Base

Destructor


🚨

Problem:

The

Derived

destructor

is

never

called
,

leading

to

memory

leaks.

Solution:

Use

Virtual

Destructor

class

Base

{

public:


Base()

{

cout

<<

"Base

Constructor"

<<

endl;

}


virtual

~Base()

{

cout

<<

"Base

Destructor"

<<

endl;

}

//

Virtual

destructor

};


Correct

Output

Base

Constructor

Derived

Constructor


Derived

Destructor

Base

Destructor


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

If

the

base

class

destructor

is

not

virtual
,

only

the

base

class

destructor

is

called.

●

Always

use

virtual

destructors

when

using

runtime

polymorphism
.


4.

override

Keyword

The

override

keyword

ensures

that

a

function

overrides

a

virtual

function

in

the

base

class.

If

no

matching

function

exists,

the

compiler

throws

an

error
.

Example:

Using

override

Correctly

class

Base

{

public:


virtual

void

show()

{}

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{

public:


void

show()

override

{}

//

Correct

};


Example:

Incorrect

Override

class

Derived

:

public

Base

{

public:


void

show(int

x)

override

{}

//

ERROR:

No

matching

function

in

base

class


};


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

Use

override

to

prevent

accidental

mistakes

when

overriding

virtual

functions.


5.

final

Keyword

The

final

keyword

prevents

further

overriding

of

a

function

or

class
.

Example:

Using

final

class

Base

{

public:


virtual

void

show()

final

{}

//

No

further

overrides

allowed

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{

public:


//

void

show()

{}

//

ERROR:

Cannot

override

final

function

};


Example:

Final

Class

class

FinalClass

final

{};



class

Derived

:

public

FinalClass

{

//

ERROR:

Cannot

inherit

from

a

final

class

};


✅

Key

Takeaway:


●

Use

final

for

security

and

performance

when

no

further

overriding

is

needed.


6.

Dynamic

Casting

Dynamic

casting

allows

safely

downcasting

(casting

a

base

class

pointer

to

a

derived

class

pointer).

It

works

only

for

polymorphic

classes

(classes

with

at

least

one

virtual

function).

Example:

Dynamic

Casting

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Base

{

public:


virtual

void

show()

{}

//

Must

be

virtual

};


class

Derived

:

public

Base

{

public:


void

display()

{

cout

<<

"Derived

class

function"

<<

endl;

}

};


int

main()

{


Base*

basePtr

=

new

Derived();



//

Safe

downcasting

using

dynamic_cast


Derived*

derivedPtr

=

dynamic_cast<Derived*>(basePtr);




if

(derivedPtr)

{

//

Check

if

casting

succeeded



derivedPtr->display();


}

else

{


cout

<<

"Failed

to

cast!"

<<

endl;


}



delete

basePtr;


return

0;

}


Output:

Derived

class

function


✅

Key

Takeaway:

●

dynamic_cast

ensures

safe

downcasting

and

prevents

undefined

behavior
.


6.

Advanced

OOP

Concepts



6.1

Composition

and

Aggregation

in

C++

In

Object-Oriented

Programming

(OOP),

composition

and

aggregation

are

used

to

represent

"has-a"

relationships

between

objects.

They

define

how

objects

are

related

and

how

their

lifecycles

are

managed.


1.

Composition

vs.

Aggregation


Both

composition

and

aggregation

establish

part-whole

relationships,

but

they

differ

in

ownership

and

lifecycle

dependency
.

Concept

Definition

Example

Compositio
n

Strong

relationship

where

the

contained

object

cannot

exist

independently

of

the

container.

A

car

has-a

engine.

If

the

car

is

destroyed,

the

engine

is

also

destroyed.

Aggregatio
n

Weaker

relationship

where

the

contained

object

can

exist

independently

of

the

container.

A

university

has-a

student.

If

the

university

closes,

students

still

exist.


2.

Composition

(Strong

Relationship)

●

Owner

(container)

manages

the

lifetime

of

the

contained

objects.

●

If

the

container

is

destroyed,

the

contained

objects

are

also

destroyed
.

●

Implemented

using

member

objects

(not

pointers).

Example:

Composition

(Car

and

Engine)

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Engine

{

public:


Engine()

{

cout

<<

"Engine

Created"

<<

endl;

}


~Engine()

{

cout

<<

"Engine

Destroyed"

<<

endl;

}


void

start()

{

cout

<<

"Engine

Started"

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Car

{

private:


Engine

engine;

//

Engine

is

part

of

Car

(strong

relationship)

public:


Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

Created"

<<

endl;

}


~Car()

{

cout

<<

"Car

Destroyed"

<<

endl;

}


void

startCar()

{

engine.start();

}

};


int

main()

{


Car

myCar;

//

Engine

is

created

when

Car

is

created


myCar.startCar();


return

0;

}

//

Car

is

destroyed,

so

Engine

is

also

destroyed.



Output:

Engine

Created

Car

Created

Engine

Started

Car

Destroyed

Engine

Destroyed


✅

Key

Takeaways:

●

The

Engine

object

is

automatically

created

when

a

Car

object

is

created.

●

When

Car

is

destroyed,

Engine

is

also

destroyed.


3.

Aggregation

(Weak

Relationship)

●

Owner

does

not

manage

the

lifetime

of

the

contained

objects.

●

If

the

container

is

destroyed,

the

contained

objects

still

exist
.

●

Implemented

using

pointers

or

references
.

Example:

Aggregation

(Student

and

University)

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


class

Student

{

public:


string

name;


Student(string

n)

:

name(n)

{}


void

show()

{

cout

<<

"Student:

"

<<

name

<<

endl;

}

};


class

University

{

private:


Student*

student;

//

Pointer

(weak

relationship)

public:


University(Student*

s)

:

student(s)

{}

//

Linking

student

to

university


void

showStudent()

{

student->show();

}

};


int

main()

{


Student

s1("Alice");


University

uni(&s1);

//

Student

exists

outside

University


uni.showStudent();



return

0;


}

//

Student

still

exists

even

after

University

is

destroyed.


Output:

Student:

Alice


✅

Key

Takeaways:

●

Student

object

exists

independently

of

University
.

●

The

University

object

only

holds

a

reference

to

a

Student
.


4.

Dependency

Management

●

In

composition
,

dependencies

are

strong
.

The

object

cannot

function

without

its

parts.

●

In

aggregation
,

dependencies

are

weak
,

meaning

objects

can

exist

without

each

other.

Example:

Dependency

in

Composition

class

Body

{

public:


void

function()

{

cout

<<

"Body

is

functioning."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Human

{

private:


Body

body;

//

Composition:

Human

cannot

exist

without

a

body

public:


void

live()

{

body.function();

}

};


Example:

Dependency

in

Aggregation

class

Teacher

{

public:


void

teach()

{

cout

<<

"Teaching

students."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

School

{

private:


Teacher*

teacher;

//

Aggregation:

School

has

a

teacher

but

doesn't

own

it

public:


School(Teacher*

t)

:

teacher(t)

{}



void

startClass()

{

teacher->teach();

}

};



5.

Ownership

Semantics

●

Composition

=

Strong

ownership

(one

object

owns

another).

●

Aggregation

=

Shared

ownership

(one

object

references

another

but

doesn’t

manage

it).

✅

Use

Composition

When:

●

Parts

cannot

exist

independently

(e.g.,

Engine

in

Car).

●

The

owner

controls

the

object’s

lifecycle.

✅

Use

Aggregation

When:

●

Objects

exist

independently

(e.g.,

Student

and

University).

●

The

owner

does

not

control

the

object’s

lifecycle.


6.

Lifecycle

Management

Object

Creation

&

Destruction

●

Composition:

Contained

objects

are

created

and

destroyed

with

the

owner.

●

Aggregation:

Contained

objects

must

be

created

and

destroyed

separately
.

Example:

Handling

Aggregation

with

Dynamic

Memory

class

Library

{

private:


string

name;

public:


Library(string

n)

:

name(n)

{}


void

show()

{

cout

<<

"Library:

"

<<

name

<<

endl;

}

};


class

City

{

private:


Library*

library;

//

Aggregation

(heap

allocation)

public:


City(string

libName)

{

library

=

new

Library(libName);

}


~City()

{

delete

library;

}

//

Manually

deleting

object


void

showLibrary()

{

library->show();

}

};



int

main()

{


City

c("Central

Library");


c.showLibrary();


return

0;

}

//

Library

must

be

manually

destroyed


✅

Key

Takeaways:

●

If

aggregation

uses

raw

pointers
,

memory

must

be

managed

manually
.

●

Smart

pointers

(
shared_ptr
,

unique_ptr
)

can

help

with

automatic

memory

management.



6.2

SOLID

Principles

in

Object-Oriented

Programming

The

SOLID

principles

are

five

fundamental

design

principles

that

improve

software

maintainability,

scalability,

and

flexibility.

They

help

create

clean,

reusable,

and

efficient

code

in

object-oriented

programming

(OOP)
.


1.

Single

Responsibility

Principle

(SRP)

"A

class

should

have

only

one

reason

to

change."

✅

Explanation:

●

Each

class

should

have

only

one

job
.

●

If

a

class

has

multiple

responsibilities
,

changes

in

one

responsibility

might

affect

others,

making

the

code

difficult

to

maintain.

❌

Bad

Example

(Violating

SRP)

class

Report

{

public:


void

generateReport()

{

cout

<<

"Generating

report..."

<<

endl;

}


void

printReport()

{

cout

<<

"Printing

report..."

<<

endl;

}

//

Printing

is

a

different

responsibility


void

saveToFile()

{

cout

<<

"Saving

report

to

file..."

<<

endl;

}

//

File

handling

is

separate

};



🔴

Problem:

This

class

mixes

multiple

responsibilities:

●

Generating

the

report

●

Printing

the

report

●

Saving

the

report

to

a

file

✅

Good

Example

(Following

SRP)

class

Report

{

public:


void

generateReport()

{

cout

<<

"Generating

report..."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

ReportPrinter

{

public:


void

printReport()

{

cout

<<

"Printing

report..."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

ReportSaver

{

public:


void

saveToFile()

{

cout

<<

"Saving

report

to

file..."

<<

endl;

}

};


✔

Now

each

class

has

a

single

responsibility

and

can

be

modified

independently.


2.

Open-Closed

Principle

(OCP)

"Software

entities

(classes,

modules,

functions)

should

be

open

for

extension,

but

closed

for

modification."

✅

Explanation:

●

We

should

extend

existing

functionality

without

modifying

existing

code.

●

Achieved

using

inheritance

and

polymorphism
.

❌

Bad

Example

(Violating

OCP)

class

Shape

{

public:


string

type;


void

draw()

{


if

(type

==

"Circle")

cout

<<

"Drawing

Circle..."

<<

endl;


else

if

(type

==

"Square")

cout

<<

"Drawing

Square..."

<<

endl;


}

};



🔴

Problem:

If

we

add

a

new

shape

(e.g.,

Triangle),

we

must

modify

draw()
,

violating

OCP.

✅

Good

Example

(Following

OCP)

class

Shape

{

public:


virtual

void

draw()

=

0;

//

Pure

virtual

function

};


class

Circle

:

public

Shape

{

public:


void

draw()

override

{

cout

<<

"Drawing

Circle..."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Square

:

public

Shape

{

public:


void

draw()

override

{

cout

<<

"Drawing

Square..."

<<

endl;

}

};


✔

Now,

new

shapes

can

be

added

without

modifying

existing

code.


3.

Liskov

Substitution

Principle

(LSP)

"Objects

of

a

derived

class

should

be

able

to

replace

objects

of

the

base

class

without

affecting

correctness."

✅

Explanation:

●

A

subclass

must

fully

substitute

its

base

class

without

changing

behavior.

●

If

a

subclass

breaks

the

functionality

of

the

base

class,

it

violates

LSP.

❌

Bad

Example

(Violating

LSP)

class

Bird

{

public:


virtual

void

fly()

{

cout

<<

"Flying..."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Penguin

:

public

Bird

{

public:


void

fly()

override

{

throw

logic_error("Penguins

can't

fly!");

}

};


🔴

Problem:


●

Penguins

cannot

fly
,

but

they

inherit

the

fly()

method,

violating

LSP.

●

Any

code

expecting

all

Bird

objects

to

fly

will

break.

✅

Good

Example

(Following

LSP)

class

Bird

{

public:


virtual

void

makeSound()

{

cout

<<

"Chirping..."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

FlyingBird

:

public

Bird

{

public:


virtual

void

fly()

{

cout

<<

"Flying..."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Sparrow

:

public

FlyingBird

{};

class

Penguin

:

public

Bird

{};

//

No

fly

method

in

Penguin


✔

Now,

Penguin

does

not

inherit

fly()
,

preventing

incorrect

behavior.


4.

Interface

Segregation

Principle

(ISP)

"Clients

should

not

be

forced

to

depend

on

interfaces

they

do

not

use."

✅

Explanation:

●

Large

interfaces

should

be

split

into

smaller,

more

specific

ones.

●

A

class

should

only

implement

methods

it

actually

needs
.

❌

Bad

Example

(Violating

ISP)

class

Machine

{

public:


virtual

void

print()

=

0;


virtual

void

scan()

=

0;


virtual

void

fax()

=

0;

};


class

Printer

:

public

Machine

{

public:


void

print()

override

{

cout

<<

"Printing..."

<<

endl;

}


void

scan()

override

{

throw

logic_error("Not

supported!");

}

//

Unnecessary

method


void

fax()

override

{

throw

logic_error("Not

supported!");

}

//

Unnecessary

method

};



🔴

Problem:

●

A

Printer

should

not

implement

scan()

or

fax()
.

✅

Good

Example

(Following

ISP)

class

IPrinter

{

public:


virtual

void

print()

=

0;

};


class

IScanner

{

public:


virtual

void

scan()

=

0;

};


class

Printer

:

public

IPrinter

{

public:


void

print()

override

{

cout

<<

"Printing..."

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Scanner

:

public

IScanner

{

public:


void

scan()

override

{

cout

<<

"Scanning..."

<<

endl;

}

};


✔

Now,

each

class

implements

only

the

required

interface
.


5.

Dependency

Inversion

Principle

(DIP)

"High-level

modules

should

not

depend

on

low-level

modules.

Both

should

depend

on

abstractions."

✅

Explanation:

●

Depend

on

abstract

interfaces

instead

of

concrete

classes
.

●

Helps

with

flexibility

and

scalability
.

❌

Bad

Example

(Violating

DIP)

class

LightBulb

{

public:


void

turnOn()

{

cout

<<

"Light

ON"

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Switch

{


private:


LightBulb

bulb;

public:


void

press()

{

bulb.turnOn();

}

};


🔴

Problem:

●

Switch

depends

directly

on

LightBulb
,

making

changes

harder.

✅

Good

Example

(Following

DIP)

class

Switchable

{

public:


virtual

void

turnOn()

=

0;

};


class

LightBulb

:

public

Switchable

{

public:


void

turnOn()

override

{

cout

<<

"Light

ON"

<<

endl;

}

};


class

Switch

{

private:

Modern

C++

Features

in

Object-Oriented

Programming


Modern

C++

(C++11,

C++14,

C++17,

C++20)

introduced

several

features

that

enhance

OOP

by

improving

memory

management,

efficiency,

and

flexibility.

Let's

explore

key

modern

C++

features

related

to

OOP.


1.

Smart

Pointers

(Memory

Management)

Smart

pointers

in

C++

manage

memory

automatically

and

help

prevent

memory

leaks

by

deallocating

memory

when

it

is

no

longer

needed.

✅

Types

of

Smart

Pointers:

1.

std::unique_ptr

–

Owns

an

object

exclusively

(no

copying).

2.

std::shared_ptr

–

Allows

multiple

shared

ownership.

3.

std::weak_ptr

–

Prevents

circular

references

in

shared_ptr
.

Example:

Using

std::unique_ptr

#include

<iostream>

#include

<memory>

//

Required

for

smart

pointers


class

Car

{

public:


Car()

{

std::cout

<<

"Car

Created\n";

}


~Car()

{

std::cout

<<

"Car

Destroyed\n";

}


void

drive()

{

std::cout

<<

"Driving...\n";

}

};


int

main()

{


std::unique_ptr<Car>

car

=

std::make_unique<Car>();

//

Creates

a

unique_ptr


car->drive();

//

Access

object

methods


return

0;

}

//

`car`

is

automatically

destroyed

when

it

goes

out

of

scope



✔

No

need

to

manually

delete

the

object

–

memory

is

handled

automatically!


2.

Move

Semantics

(Efficient

Resource

Transfer)

Move

semantics

eliminate

unnecessary

copying

of

objects,

improving

performance.

✅

How

Move

Semantics

Work?

●

Introduces

rvalue

references

(
&&
)
,

which

allow

moving

resources

instead

of

copying.

●

Used

in

move

constructors

and

move

assignment

operators
.

Example:

Move

Constructor

#include

<iostream>

#include

<vector>


class

Data

{

private:


std::vector<int>

numbers;

public:


Data(std::vector<int>

vec)

:

numbers(std::move(vec))

{

//

Move

constructor


std::cout

<<

"Move

Constructor

Called\n";


}

};


int

main()

{


std::vector<int>

vec

=

{1,

2,

3,

4,

5};


Data

obj(std::move(vec));

//

Moves

`vec`

into

`obj`,

avoiding

expensive

copy


return

0;


}


✔

std::move(vec)

transfers

ownership

instead

of

copying

the

vector.


3.

Perfect

Forwarding

(Efficient

Function

Arguments)

Perfect

forwarding

allows

preserving

the

type

of

arguments

passed

to

a

function

without

unnecessary

copies
.

Example:

Using

std::forward

#include

<iostream>

#include

<utility>

//

Required

for

std::forward


class

Example

{

public:


template

<typename

T>


void

process(T&&

value)

{

//

Universal

reference


forward(value);


}



void

forward(const

std::string&

str)

{


std::cout

<<

"Lvalue:

"

<<

str

<<

std::endl;


}



void

forward(std::string&&

str)

{


std::cout

<<

"Rvalue:

"

<<

str

<<

std::endl;


}

};



int

main()

{


Example

obj;


std::string

text

=

"Hello";




obj.process(text);

//

Calls

lvalue

version


obj.process(std::move(text));

//

Calls

rvalue

version

}


✔

Preserves

the

type

of

arguments
,

improving

function

efficiency.


4.

Lambda

Expressions

(Inline

Functions)

Lambdas

are

anonymous

functions

that

simplify

code

by

replacing

small

function

objects

or

callbacks.

✅

Lambda

Syntax

[capture](parameters)

->

return_type

{

function_body

};


Example:

Using

a

Lambda

#include

<iostream>

#include

<vector>

#include

<algorithm>


int

main()

{


std::vector<int>

numbers

=

{1,

2,

3,

4,

5};



std::for_each(numbers.begin(),

numbers.end(),

[](int

n)

{



std::cout

<<

n

*

2

<<

"

";


});




return

0;

}


✔

Lambdas

improve

readability

and

reduce

the

need

for

extra

functions.


5.

STL

Containers

with

Objects

STL

(
Standard

Template

Library
)

containers

like

vector
,

map
,

and

unordered_map

work

well

with

objects.

Example:

std::vector

of

Objects

#include

<iostream>

#include

<vector>


class

Car

{

public:


std::string

brand;


Car(std::string

b)

:

brand(b)

{}


void

show()

{

std::cout

<<

"Car

Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

std::endl;

}

};


int

main()

{


std::vector<Car>

cars

=

{

Car("Toyota"),

Car("Honda"),

Car("BMW")

};



for

(const

auto&

car

:

cars)

{



car.show();


}


return

0;

}


✔

STL

containers

manage

objects

efficiently
,

reducing

manual

memory

handling.






















EXTRA


1.

C++

Encapsulation

In

C++,

object-oriented

programming

allows

us

to

bundle

together

data

members

(such

as

variables,

arrays,

etc.)

and

its

related

functions

into

a

single

entity.

This

programming

feature

is

known

as

encapsulation.



In

Example

1,

we

bundled

together

the

related

variables

brand
,

model

and

mileage

with

the

function

show_data()

into

a

class

named

Car
.

class

Car

{


public:



//

class

data


string

brand;


string

model;


int

mileage

=

0;



//

class

function


void

show_data()

{


//

code


}


};

Encapsulation

ensures

that

only

member

functions

of

a

class

can

access

its

data,

which

results

in

data

hiding.

In

C++,

we

hide

data

using

the

private

and

protected

keywords.

In

contrast,

using

the

public

keyword

for

certain

class

members

makes

those

members

accessible

to

all

other

functions

and

classes.

Example-2: Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are diﬀerent sections
like

the

accounts

section,

ﬁnance

section,

sales

section,

etc.

The

ﬁnance

section

handles

all

the

ﬁnancial

transactions

and

keeps

records

of

all

the

data

related

to

ﬁnance.

Similarly,

the

sales

section

handles

all

the

sales-related

activities

and

keeps

records

of

all

the

sales.

Now

there

may

arise

a

situation

when

for

some

reason

an

oﬃcial

from

the

ﬁnance

section

needs

all

the

data

about

sales

in

a

particular

month.

In

this

case,

he

is

not

allowed

to

directly

access

the

data

of

the

sales

section.

He

will

ﬁrst

have

to

contact

some

other

oﬃcer

in

the

sales

section

and

then

request

him

to

give

the

particular

data.

This

is

what

encapsulation

is.

Here

the

data

of

the

sales

section

and

the

employees

that

can

manipulate

them

are

wrapped

under

a

single

name

“sales

section”.

Key

Features

of

Encapsulation:

1.

Restricted

Direct

Access:

○

Functions

inside

a

class

cannot

be

accessed

directly.

○

An

object

of

the

class

is

required

to

access

these

functions

that

use

member

variables.

2.

Encapsulation

Requires

Data

Usage

Inside

Functions:

○

A

function

inside

a

class

must

use

member

variables

of

that

class

to

be

considered

encapsulated.

3.

Encapsulation

is

Not

Just

About

Having

a

Class:

○

If

a

function

inside

a

class

does

not

use

the

class’s

member

variables,

then

it

is

not

considered

encapsulation.

4.

Improves

Code

Quality:

○

Readability

&

Maintainability:

Organizes

code

in

a

structured

manner.

○

Security:

Protects

data

from

unauthorized

access.

5.

Controlled

Data

Modification:

○

By

using

getter

and

setter

methods,

encapsulation

ensures

that

data

is

accessed

and

modified

in

a

controlled

way.

2.

C++

Abstraction

In

object-oriented

programming,

abstraction

refers

to

the

concept

of

showing

only

the

necessary

information

to

the

user

i.e.

hiding

the

complex

details

of

program

implementation

and

execution.

For

example,

let

us

consider

a

slightly

modified

version

of

the

Car

class:

class

Car

{



private
:



//

class

data


int

speed;



//

class

function


void

show_car_status
()

{


//

code


}

};

Suppose

we

want

the

show_car_status()

function

to

show

the

status

of

the

car

based

on

the

value

of

the

speed

variable.

We

can

implement

such

conditional

statements

using

the

if...else

statement

inside

the

show_car_status()

function.

void

show_car_status
()

{


if

(speed

!=

0
)


cout

<<

"The

car

is

being

driven."

<<

endl
;


else


cout

<<

"The

car

is

stationary."

<<

endl
;

}

Here,

we

do

not

need

to

show

the

user

all

the

codes

we

have

written

to

determine

if

the

car

is

stationary

or

not;

we

just

need

to

show

them

whether

the

car

is

being

driven

or

not

depending

on

its

speed
.

In

other

words,

we

are

only

giving

useful

and

relevant

information

to

the

user,

while

hiding

all

the

unnecessary

details.

This

is

data

abstraction

in

OOP .

To

learn

more

about

abstraction,

visit

our

C++

Abstraction

tutorial.

Note:

Abstraction

is

not

the

same

as

data

hiding.

Abstraction

is

showing

only

the

relevant

information,

while

data

hiding

is

restricting

access

to

data


members

(variables,

arrays,

structures,

etc.)

so

that

they

cannot

be

accessed

from

outside

the

class.

3.

C++

Inheritance

Inheritance

in

C++

allows

us

to

create

a

new

class

(derived

class)

from

an

existing

class

(base

class).

The

derived

class

inherits

features

from

the

base

class

and

can

have

additional

features

of

its

own.

#include

<iostream>

using

namespace

std;


//

base

class

class

Vehicle

{


public:



string

brand;




void

show_brand()

{


cout

<<

"Brand:

"

<<

brand

<<

endl;


}


};


//

derived

class

class

Car

:

public

Vehicle

{



public:




string

model;




void

show_model()

{


cout

<<

"Model:

"

<<

model

<<

endl;


}

};


int

main()

{




//

create

an

object

of

Car

class


Car

my_car;



//

initialize

variables

of

my_car


my_car.brand

=

"Honda";


my_car.model

=

"Accord";



//

display

variables

of

my_car


my_car.show_brand();


my_car.show_model();



return

0;


}

Output

Brand:

Honda

Model:

Accord

Here,

●

Vehicle

is

the

base

class.

●

Car

is

the

derived

class.


The

derived

class

inherits

the

features

of

the

base

class.

We

can

see

this

from

the

brand

variable

and

the

show_brand()

function,

since

the

Car

object

my_car

can

access

them.

In

addition

to

the

features

of

the

base

class,

the

derived

class

also

has

features

of

its

own.

The

unique

features

of

the

Car

class

are:

●

model

-

a

string

variable

●

show_model()

-

a

function

that

prints

the

model

variable.

We

can

also

see

that

the

Vehicle

class

has

not

been

modified

by

its

derived

class.

4.

C++

Polymorphism

Polymorphism

is

the

ability

to

use

a

common

function

(or

operator)

in

multiple

ways.

In

C++,

polymorphism

is

implemented

with

the

help

of

function

overloading,

operator

overloading,

function

overriding,

and

virtual

functions.

Let's

look

at

function

overriding

as

an

example.

### 🧰 Common OOP Keywords in C++
`class`, `struct`, `public`, `protected`, `private`, `virtual`, `override`, `final`, `this`, `const`, `mutable`, `friend`

### 🧠 Pointers & Ownership (Modern C++)
- `std::unique_ptr<T>` — sole owner
- `std::shared_ptr<T>` — shared owner
- `std::weak_ptr<T>` — non-owning observer

### 🧪 Virtual vs Override
- Mark base functions `virtual` to enable runtime polymorphism.
- Mark derived overrides with `override` to catch signature mistakes.

---

## 🗂 Index & Search Tips

- Search for class names or keywords like **constructor**, **destructor**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**.
- Use compound searches, e.g., `virtual override` or `this pointer` to jump to key parts quickly.
